			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>
				I am a software engineer with a background in IC testing.
				Details about me can be found on my linked-in page

			<h1>About This Site</h1>
			<p>
				Jekyll did not seem as flexible as using gulp, swig, bootstrap and jquery.
				The look and feel of the later tools is better, mobile friendly and can be leveraged elsewhere.
